Safe Moodle Quiz
================

The intent is to carry out online-exams (quizzes) safely. 

This patch adds the following new features to the quiz in moodle:
- attending a quiz only with a certain safe browser.
- disabling the navigation in the quiz.

In the properties of the moodle-quiz there is a new field 
"Safe browser". The default value for this field is "none", 
that means that every browser can connect to this quiz. If 
a safe browser is choosen from the list, the quiz becomes a
safe quiz. A student can attend this quiz only with the 
choosen safe browser. During the quiz the navigation in 
moodle is disabled and the students cannot leave the quiz.


Changes in Moodle:
------------------

For the new features the following files were customized:
- MOODLE_ROOT/mod/quiz/attempt.php
- MOODLE_ROOT/mod/quiz/mod_form.php
- MOODLE_ROOT/mod/quiz/review.php
- MOODLE_ROOT/mod/quiz/view.php
- MOODLE_ROOT/lang/en_utf8/quiz.php
- MOODLE_ROOT/lang/en_utf8/help/quiz/safebrowser.html

Other languages (german):
- MOODLE_DATA/lang/de_utf8/quiz.php
- MOODLE_DATA/lang/de_utf8/help/quiz/safebrowser.html

Changes in the moodle database:
A new field "safebrowser" in the table "prefix_quiz" 
(i.e. "mdl_quiz"), that stores the name of the browser 
in the db.

The changes are based on Moodle 1.9.1


Installation:
-------------

There are two ways to install the safe moodle quiz: 

1) Manually copy the changed files to your moodle-installation:
   - Copy attempt.php, mod_form.php, review.php and view.php to
     your directory MOODLE_ROOT/mod/quiz/ and replace the existing
     files.
   - Copy quiz.php to the directory MOODLE_ROOT/lang/en_utf8/ and
     replace the existing one. 
   - Copy the new help-file safebrowser.html to the directory
     MOODLE_ROOT/lang/en_utf8/help/quiz/.
   - Execute the provided sql-file safe_quiz.sql in your database, 
     this adds a new field "safebrowser" to the table "prefix_quiz".
     (Replace "prefix" with the prefix of your moodle-database.)
   - Optionally copy the german language file quiz.php to the
     directory MOODLE_DATA/lang/de_utf8/ and replace the existing
     one. Add the german help file safebrowser.html to the 
     directory MOODLE_DATA/lang/de_utf8/help/quiz/.


2) Run the provided patches:
   - Copy the file safe_quiz.patch to your MOODLE_ROOT directory.
     Change to MOODLE_ROOT and execute the patch: 
     "patch -p1 < safe_quiz.patch". (Alternatively you can test it
     first with "patch --dry-run -p1 < safe_quiz.patch". This prints
     out a list of the files that will be modified without modifying
     them.)
   - Execute the provided sql-file safe_quiz.sql in your database, 
     this adds a new field "safebrowser" to the table "prefix_quiz". 
     (Replace "prefix" with the prefix of your moodle-database.)
   - Optionally copy the german_safe_quiz.patch to your MOODLE_DATA
     directory. Change to MOODLE-DATA and execute the patch:
     "patch -p1 < german_safe_quiz.patch".
