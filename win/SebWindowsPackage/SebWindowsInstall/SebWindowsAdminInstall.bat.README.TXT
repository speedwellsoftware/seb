echo Safe Exam Browser administrative installation
echo =============================================
echo.
echo The whole installation procedure comprises three phases:
echo.
ehco.
echo 1st phase (configuration):
echo --------------------------
echo The teacher configures SEB by modifiying
echo the "MsgHook.ini" and "SebStarter.ini" files using a text editor.
echo.
echo If third-party applications shall be permitted,
echo the teacher can additionally edit the "SebStarter.bat" file.
echo This batch file enhances the PATH variable by the paths to the
echo third-party applications, such that SEB can find the executables
echo of these applications when they are called during an exam.
echo.
echo.
echo 2nd phase (administrative installation):
echo ----------------------------------------
echo The teacher executes the "SebWindowsAdminInstall.bat" script
echo when logged in as an administrator (not as a standard user!)
echo.
echo This script runs the MSI installer with the option /a
echo and the installation file SebWindowsInstall.msi.
echo.
echo It creates a source image named "SebWindowsAdminImage",
echo containing a copy of the SebWindowsInstall.msi file,
echo and a "Common Application Data Folder".
echo.
echo Afterwards, the script copies the (previously modified)
echo configuration files MsgHook.ini and SebStarter.ini
echo to the "Common Application Data Folder".
echo.
echo [And if desired, the script copies also the batch file
echo SebStarter.bat to the Program Files directory,
echo where SEB has been installed.]
echo.
echo The source image can then serve as a network share,
echo so a workgroup with access to the network share
echo can install SEB from this remote source image.
echo.
echo Rather than offering the source image to the students,
echo the teacher can also pack the source image as a zip file,
echo e.g. "SebWindowsInstall.zip",
echo and distribute the zip file to the students.
echo.
echo.
echo 3rd phase (actual installation):
echo --------------------------------
echo In order to install SEB, a student must
echo.
echo - connect to the network share, enter the source image
echo "SebWindowsAdminImage" and double-click the
echo "SebWindowsInstall.msi" file
echo or
echo - unzip the "SebWindowsInstall.zip" file
echo in an arbitrary folder (e.g. "C:\tmp") on his machine
echo and then double-click the "SebWindowsInstall.msi" file.
echo.
