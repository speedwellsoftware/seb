echo Safe Exam Browser installation
echo ------------------------------
echo.
echo For a full installation, you must execute the "SebWindowsInstall.bat"
echo script when logged in as an administrator (not as a standard user!)
echo.
echo Reason:
echo.
echo This script first runs the MSI installer with the
echo installation file "SebWindowsInstall.msi".
echo.
echo Afterwards, the script copies the configuration files
echo "MsgHook.ini" and "SebStarter.ini" to the "ProgramData" directory
echo (overwriting the default MsgHook.ini and SebStarter.ini).
echo.
echo [And if desired, the script copies also the batch file
echo "SebStarter.bat" to the "Program Files" directory,
echo where SEB has been installed.]
echo.
echo If you execute this script as a standard user,
echo the MSI installer will prompt you for an administrator password.
echo Even after successful installation in administrator mode,
echo the script will then fall back to standard user rights.
echo.
echo So the "SebStarter.ini" and "MsgHook.ini" files will _not_ be copied
echo to the "ProgramData" directory due to lack of administrator rights!
echo In this case, you will have to _manually_ copy these .ini files
echo as an administrator afterwards.
echo.
echo Solution:
echo.
echo To avoid this, please execute the "SebWindowsInstall.bat"
echo script by right-clicking on its name in the Windows Explorer,
echo and then choosing "Run as administrator".
echo You will then be prompted for the administrator password,
echo and the whole script will be executed with administrator rights
echo (running the MSI installer and copying the configured files)
echo.
