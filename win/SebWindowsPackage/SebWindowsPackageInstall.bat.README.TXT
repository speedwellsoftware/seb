------------------------------

For a full installation, you must execute the

SebWindowsPackageInstall.bat

script when logged in as an administrator, not as a standard user!

Reason:

This script first runs the MSI installer with the
installation file SebWindowsPackageInstall.msi.

Afterwards, the script copies the configuration files
MsgHook.ini and SebStarter.ini to the Program Data directory
(overwriting the default MsgHook.ini and SebStarter.ini).

[And if desired, the script copies also the batch file
SebStarter.bat to the Program Files directory,
where SEB has been installed.]

If you execute this script as a standard user, the MSI installer
will prompt you for an administrator password.
Even after successful installation in administrator mode,
the script will then fall back to standard user rights.

So the SebStarter.ini and MsgHook.ini files will _not_ be copied to
the Program Data directory due to lack of administrator rights!
In this case, you will have to _manually_ copy these .ini files
as an administrator afterwards.

Solution:

To avoid this, please execute the SebWindowsPackageInstall.bat
script by right-clicking on its name in the Explorer,
and then choosing "Run as administrator".
You will then be prompted for the administrator password,
and the whole script will be executed with administrator rights
(running the MSI installer _and_ copying the configured files).
