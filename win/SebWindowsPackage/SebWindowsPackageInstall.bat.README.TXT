

Safe Exam Browser installation
------------------------------

For a full installation, you must execute the

SebWindowsPackageInstall.bat

script when logged in as an administrator, not as a standard user!

Reason:

If you execute this script as a standard user, the MSI installer
will ask you for an administrator password.
Even after successful installation in administrator mode,
the script will then fall back to standard user rights.

So the SebStarter.ini and MsgHook.ini files will _not_ be copied to
the program data directory due to lack of administrative rights!
In this case, you will have to _manually_ copy these .ini files
as an administrator afterwards.

Solution:

To avoid this, please execute the SebWindowsPackageInstall.bat
script by right-clicking on its name in the Explorer,
and then choosing "Run as administrator".
You will then be prompted for the administrator password,
and the whole script will be executed with administrator rights
(running the MSI installer and afterwards copying the .ini files).
