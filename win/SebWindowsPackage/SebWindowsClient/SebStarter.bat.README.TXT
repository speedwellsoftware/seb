If additional applications shall be used in conjunction with SEB,
these applications must be installed previously to SEB,
using administrator rights, too.

After installing the permitted additional applications,
the teacher must check the paths to the program executables
of these applications. There are two ways to tell SEB where
it can find these program executables:


1.) Enter the _full_ pathes to the program executables
into the SebStarter.ini file.

Example:

If you have installed the "VMware View Client" software,
and its program executable "wswc.exe" lies in the directory
"C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware View\Client\bin\",
then enter the full path to the program executable
in the SebStarter.ini file:

PERMITTED_APPS=VMwareViewClient,"C:\Program Files\VMware\VMware View\Client\bin\wswc.exe";


2.) Enter only the _short_ pathes to the program executables
into the SebStarter.ini file.

In our example, "wscw.exe" is the short path,
so enter in the SebStarter.ini file only

PERMITTED_APPS=VMwareViewClient,wswc.exe;

But in this case, you have to additionally enter in SebStarter.bat the lines

set PermittedAppDir1="%ProgramFiles%\VMware\VMware View\Client\bin"
set PermittedAppDir1(x86)="%ProgramFiles(x86)%\VMware\VMware View\Client\bin"

(If you are not sure whether the full path contains "(x86)" or not,
just enter both lines to cover both cases).
The PATH variable is then automatically enhanced
by this path to the program executable.

It is possible to permit several such applications,
using "PermittedAppDir1=...", "PermittedAppDir2=...", etc.
